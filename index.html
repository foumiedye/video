     <h3>magnet color fun time, video and code, 2018</h3>
    <p>once upon a time i was a dumbass kid, we all were. said dumbass kid decided itd be rad to hold a magnet in front of my old windows desktop, cuz it made the screen turn pretty colors. id learn later that doing so would fuck my entire shit up, but it was a cool experience anyway</p>

     <h3>jooezone, video and digital illustration with code, 2018</h3>
    <p>final project. was kinda outta ideas and didnt wanna be angsty again, so i made a cute lil interactive website of jooe from momoland. she did some commercials for tropicana sparkling which involved utilizing bluescreen effects, so i took advantage of that and made 6 short videos  of her. it was fun!</p>
